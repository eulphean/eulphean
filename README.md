## Hey there, it's `Amay` 👋🏼<br />

>`New-Media Artist and Frontend Graphics Software Engineer`<br/>With a background in software engineering and fine art, I enjoy working at the fluid intersection of art & technology. I use software as a tool to sculpt images and data, to create experiences that humanize technology.
## **More About `Me`🧍**
> As an `interdisciplinary artist`, I get a lot of joy in exploring historical and political subjects, and expressing them through the medium of cutting-edge technologies.
> - Checkout my visual language in this [portfolio](https://heyzine.com/flip-book/0070a9c08d.html).
> - Over the years, I've developed works with technologies like `machine learning`, `blockchain`, `augmented reality`, `virtual reality`, `net-art`, and `computer graphics`.
> - I often collaborate with other amazing artists to produce projects.
> - Practicing new-media art has made me `fearless` in experimenting with new technologies.
<br />

> In the industry, I position myself as a `software engineer`, with an expertise in `frontend computer graphics`. 
> - Checkout my frontend graphics engineering [portfolio](https://heyzine.com/flip-book/fa5164ac35.html).
> - My recent stack includes `Typescript`, `React.js`, `Three.js`, `React-Three/Fiber`, `Tailwind.css`, and `Material UI`
> - I also have a strong understanding of `WebGL` fundamentals and write custom `GLSL` for my projects.  
> - I often use `Blender` to scupt, rig, and animate scences, and bring them to life on the web.
> - In the past, I've thoroughly worked with `React-Native`, `C++`, and `Python` as well.
